# Section 2 - Drawing with Python Turtle II

## Some methods:
* goto(x, y)
* speed("fast")
* pensize()
* circle()
* undo()

## Add a bit randomness:
* import random
* random.randint(-200,200)

## function and var
* define a function to draw a square
* define a function with variables to draw square with different sizes and colours
* define a function with variables to make it possible to draw different kinds of shapes (eg. triangle, square, pantagon etc.), with different colours
Question: how many var do we need
* add in a bit of randomness

## Homework:
make a functions to draw a repeated pattern, with freedom to set up var
eg. a flower
